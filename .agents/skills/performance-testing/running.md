# Running benchmarks

Detail for the [performance-testing](SKILL.md) skill. The perf project's
`Program.Main` typically uses `BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(...)` so all CLI
arguments are forwarded to BenchmarkDotNet. Run from the repo root.

For before/after discipline and reading the result columns, see
[interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md). Drilling a benchmark down to
the hot method or source line is a repo-specific page supplied by the overlay
(the trace-analyzer skill).

## Specifying the target framework is required

Because the perf project is multi-targeted, **`dotnet run` requires `-f <tfm>`** -
the SDK will not pick one for you and the run fails (NETSDK1005 or an ambiguous
target error) if you omit it. Always pass an explicit moniker (e.g. `-f net10.0`
or `-f net481`, or whatever the repo's current modern version resolves to).

```powershell
# Modern .NET
dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --project <root>.perf -- --filter *MyBenchmark*

# .NET Framework
dotnet run -c Release -f net481 --project <root>.perf -- --filter *MyBenchmark*
```

`-c Release` is **mandatory**. Debug builds are not representative and
BenchmarkDotNet will warn loudly.

When a change touches code that compiles for both targets, **run both TFMs**. The
results often differ dramatically - the modern runtime has vectorized BCL APIs
that .NET Framework lacks, so a hand-tuned Framework fast path may look identical
to the generic path on the modern runtime.

## Run a single class or method

```powershell
# All benchmarks in a class
dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --project <root>.perf -- --filter *MyBenchmark*

# A single method
dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --project <root>.perf -- --filter *MyBenchmark.Variant*
```

The trailing `*` matters: `--filter` globs the full benchmark ID
(`Namespace.Type.Method`), so `*MyBenchmark.Variant*` also matches the
parameterized cases (`Variant(x: 1)`, ...) that a bare `*MyBenchmark.Variant`
would miss.

## Interactive picker

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release -f <tfm> --project <root>.perf
```

With no `--filter`, BenchmarkSwitcher prints a numbered menu. Useful when
exploring. `-f <tfm>` is still required on a multi-targeted project.

## Useful extra switches

- `--job short` - very fast, low-confidence run; good for smoke-testing a new
  benchmark before committing to a full run.
- `--memory` - enables the memory diagnoser for this run even if the class is not
  decorated. Prefer the attribute.
- `--exporters github` - emits a GitHub-flavored Markdown report alongside the
  default outputs.
