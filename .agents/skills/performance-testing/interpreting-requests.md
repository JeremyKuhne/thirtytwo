# From a user's question to a measurement

Detail for the [performance-testing](SKILL.md) skill. The other sub-pages cover
the *mechanics* - authoring a benchmark, running it, reading the columns. This
page covers the step before all of them: turning a vague, outcome-shaped user
question into a concrete scenario, the right measurement, and a useful answer.

Users almost never ask in tooling terms. They ask "how long does this take?",
"how much memory does this use?", "where is the time going?", or "help me make
this faster". They do not know to capture a trace, write a benchmark, pick a
scenario, or drill from method to line - **that translation is your job.** Lead
them through it; do not hand back a tool and a shrug.

In this page, *profile* / *the trace analyzer* refers to whatever profiling tool
the consuming repo wires in its overlay (capture an EventPipe or ETW trace, rank
the hot frames, drill to callers and source lines). The mechanics of that tool
live in the overlay's profiling page; the judgment about *when* to reach for it
lives here.

## Map the question to the workflow

| The user asks | They want | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| "How long does X take?" / "Is X fast enough?" | a latency number for a real scenario | use BenchmarkDotNet for repeatable in-process work or an external harness for startup/phased work; report uncertainty on each supported TFM |
| "How much memory does X use?" / "Does X allocate?" | the requested allocation, retention, or process-memory measure | choose the matching measurement boundary ([interpreting-results](interpreting-results.md)) |
| "Where is the time spent?" / "Why is X slow?" | the hot method or line | profile a trace (EventPipe on the modern runtime, **ETW on .NET Framework**), rank -> callers -> lines; if a thin driver/wrapper tops the modern ranking, cross-check under ETW - inlining can misattribute self-time to the host |
| "What's allocating?" / "What's the GC doing?" | the hot alloc site / GC pressure | the allocation or GC view of a trace |
| "Make X faster" / "improve this method" | a *verified* improvement | the bounded loop below: scenario -> baseline/hypothesis -> mechanism screen -> product pilot -> confirmation |
| "Did my change help / regress anything?" | a before/after delta | baseline before, re-run after, diff every affected supported TFM ([interpreting-results](interpreting-results.md)) |

## First, nail the scenario - a method has no single "speed"

Cost depends on inputs. Before writing any benchmark, decide *what* to measure.
Read the method and answer as much as you can from the code, then ask the user
only what the code cannot tell you. Offer a default with every question so they
can just say "yes".

Things worth pinning down:

- **Inputs and sizes.** Typical case, and the worst case that matters. For a
  span/string API: empty, small, large, and any pathological shape (all-match,
  no-match, deep nesting). Propose a representative set.
- **Target framework(s).** Default to **both** the modern and the Framework
  target when the code compiles for both - results diverge and that divergence is
  often the point. Only narrow to one if the user says so or the code is
  `#if NET`-only.
- **Latency vs throughput.** A per-call latency number and a bulk-throughput
  number answer different questions; ask which they care about.
- **A baseline to compare against.** "Fast" is meaningless alone. Compare against
  the BCL equivalent, the previous implementation, or a stated target.

**Do not stall on questions you can answer yourself.** If the inputs are obvious
from the signature, state the scenario set you picked ("I'll measure empty, a
32-char, and a 4 KB input on both TFMs") and proceed. Asking the user to spell
out what you could have read is its own failure.

## The "make X faster" journey - lead them through it

This is the request that most needs handholding. Walk these steps out loud, one
at a time, so the user sees the method:

For a multi-candidate or end-to-end optimization, treat the steps below as an
escalation funnel, not work to run in full for every idea. Before the first
candidate, write down a time budget, the maximum candidate count, the cheapest
screen, the real product gate, and the stop rule. Use a short benchmark screen and
a small real-scenario pilot before broad matrices, repeated retained runs, or
before/after profiling. See [investigation-workflow.md](investigation-workflow.md)
for the staged workflow and default limits. A candidate that fails correctness, a
hard allocation/memory cap, or the stable product pilot is rejected; more profiling
does not rescue it.

1. **Find the scenario.** Read the method, identify the inputs that drive cost,
   propose a representative set. Confirm or proceed with stated assumptions.
2. **Establish a reusable baseline.** Use BenchmarkDotNet for a repeatable in-process operation, or an external fresh-process harness when startup, discovery, environment initialization, or phase boundaries are part of the outcome. Run every affected supported TFM. This is the initial answer to "how slow is it today" and the comparison for the mechanism screen; defer the full matrix until a candidate passes the product pilot.
3. **Find where the cost is when the target is unclear.** Profile the baseline:
   rank -> callers -> lines for CPU, or the allocation view if `Allocated` is the
   problem. When code and a targeted benchmark already isolate the cost, state that
   evidence and skip a broad profile. Tell the user the hypothesis in plain language
   ("62% of the time is in the inner copy loop at `Parser.cs:214`; it re-walks the
   segment each pass").
4. **Form a hypothesis tied to the evidence, then change one thing.** Connect the
   edit to what the profile showed. For *how* to write the hot path, branch to
   the codegen skills: the framework-JIT-optimization skill for specialization /
   unrolling / BCL-delegation, and the scratch-buffer-strategy skill for
   stackalloc vs pool vs a stack-with-pool-fallback buffer.
5. **Verify in stages.** Run the narrow correctness check and short benchmark screen, then the real-scenario product pilot. Only a survivor earns the full benchmark on every affected supported TFM, retained product confirmation against the actual gate, and candidate before/after attribution ([investigation workflow](investigation-workflow.md)). Confirm nothing regressed, especially `Allocated` and other supported targets. A faster wall clock with the targeted frame unchanged is noise or a different win; say so.
6. **Report and offer the next drill.** Show the before/after for all measured targets and the line-level evidence, then suggest the logical follow-up.

## Translate the numbers back into the user's words

Do not paste a raw table and stop. Answer the question they asked:

- *How long?* -> "About 180 ns per call for a typical 32-char input, rising to
  ~12 us for a 4 KB input. That's roughly 1.4x the BCL's `string.Format` on the
  modern runtime, and 3x faster on .NET Framework where the BCL path has no
  vectorization."
- *How much memory?* -> "It's allocation-free on the span path (0 B). The string
  overload allocates one result string of N bytes and nothing else." or "It
  allocates a 1 KB array per call - that's the buffer it never pools."
- *Where?* -> "Two thirds of the time is in `<method>` at `<file:line>`, doing
  `<what>`. The rest is the bounds checks the loop repeats."

When the repository supports multiple TFMs, surface a divergence when there is
one - it is frequently the most actionable thing you can say.

## Follow up - suggest the next question, don't wait for it

After every result, the user usually has a next question they have not formed
yet. Offer it:

- After a **latency** number -> "Want the allocation profile too, or a comparison
  against the BCL / your previous version?"
- After a **memory** number -> "Want me to find the allocation site, or try a
  pooled / `stackalloc` version and measure it?"
- After a **hot spot** -> "Want me to try `<specific change the evidence
  suggests>` and measure whether it helps?"
- After a **hot spot whose call-tree *shape* is the interesting part** (deep
  recursion, a fan of shallow callers, or you want to show an
  attribution flip visually) -> "Want me to open this as an interactive flame
  graph so you can explore it?" Offer this *after* the line-level answer, not
  instead of it - the direct line/heat drill is the more practical result.
- After a **shallow line/heat map** (too few samples to attribute per line) ->
  "The trace sampled too coarsely to pin the hot lines; want me to re-capture
  under ETW (~1 kHz) for a deeper heat map?"
- After a **modern-runtime method ranking topped by a driver/wrapper frame** (its
  body is mostly a call into a loop) -> "EventPipe may be crediting an inlined
  callee's time to its host; want me to re-capture under ETW - which resolves the
  inlinee - and diff the two?" Lengthening the run will not fix this; only ETW
  reattributes it.
- After an **improvement** -> offer a larger/worst-case or sustained control, and
  check other supported TFMs when they exist.
- After a **surprising divergence** -> "The .NET Framework path is 3x slower
  here; want me to dig into why (likely the missing vectorized BCL API)?"

## Anti-patterns

- **Handing back tooling instead of an answer.** "You can run a benchmark with
  `dotnet run ...`" is a failure when the user asked "is this fast?". Run it and
  tell them.
- **Measuring without a scenario.** A benchmark over an unrepresentative input
  answers a question nobody asked. Pin the scenario first.
- **One TFM when the code targets both.** The divergence is usually the story -
  and on .NET Framework it is often not just a different number but a different
  *hotspot*: the Framework JIT inlines far less, so the hot frame can move
  entirely. Profile .NET Framework directly under ETW rather than reading its
  hotspot off the modern-runtime EventPipe trace.
- **Trusting the modern-runtime EventPipe *method* ranking under heavy
  inlining.** It credits an inlined callee's self-time to its physical host, so a
  thin driver/wrapper can top the ranking while the real hot loop reads near-zero
  - the same hotspot move, this time between *capture methods* on one TFM.
  Cross-check under ETW when a wrapper tops the ranking; duration will not fix it.
- **A single Mean with no error bars or allocation column.** Sub-microsecond
  deltas are usually noise; trust `Allocated` and deltas outside `Error`/`StdDev`
  ([interpreting-results](interpreting-results.md)).
- **Optimizing without an evidence-based hypothesis.** Profile when the target is
  unclear; when code and a targeted benchmark already isolate it, record that
  evidence instead. Guessing wastes the change.
- **Running retained evidence for every candidate.** Three-run matrices, high launch
  counts, and before/after profiles belong after a candidate passes the cheap screen
  and product pilot. Otherwise rigor becomes an unbounded search cost rather than a
  decision tool.
- **Continuing after a hard gate failed.** Do not broaden the matrix, tune thresholds,
  or capture attribution for code that already missed correctness, allocation, memory,
  or product-impact gates. Record the rejection and move on.
- **Declaring victory from a wall-clock drop alone.** Confirm the targeted cost
  moved and nothing else regressed.
