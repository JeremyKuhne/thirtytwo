# Performance testing

If `overlay.md` exists beside this file, read it before acting; it contains
repository-specific bindings. This core remains usable without it.

This skill turns a user's outcome-shaped performance question into a concrete,
validated measurement and a useful answer. It covers
[BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) for repeatable in-process
operations and external harnesses for fresh-process startup, command discovery,
or multi-phase workflows.

A consuming repository wires concrete project names, supported target frameworks,
cross-skill links, and optional profiling tooling in its overlay. This core uses
`<root>.perf` for a conventional perf project and `<tfm>` for a target-framework
moniker. Measure every supported target affected by the change; a single-target
repository runs only its one target.

When a repository has a Framework-only source tree, references to those types
from a shared benchmark must be guarded with `#if NETFRAMEWORK`.

## Starting from a user's question

Users ask outcome questions - "how long does this take?", "how much memory does
this use?", "where is the time going?", "help me make this faster?" - not tooling
commands. They will not pick a scenario, write a benchmark, or capture a trace on
their own; **translating the question into a measurement and leading them through
it is the job.** Before reaching for the mechanics below, read
[interpreting-requests.md](interpreting-requests.md): it maps each kind of
question to the right workflow, says which clarifications to ask (and which to
answer yourself from the code), walks the "make X faster" journey end to end, and
lists the follow-ups to offer once a result is in hand. The rest of this skill is
the *how*; that page is the *what to measure and why*.

Choose the narrowest workflow that answers the question:

| Need | Start with | Escalate only when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One latency/allocation number | [running.md](running.md) | the scenario or result needs explanation |
| A new benchmark | [authoring.md](authoring.md) | the benchmark exposes a multi-phase investigation |
| Interpret an A/B result | [interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md) | the targeted cost is unclear |
| Find a hot method/line | the repository profiling overlay | a code change needs measured verification |
| Try multiple optimization candidates | [investigation-workflow.md](investigation-workflow.md) | each stage's gate passes |

**Related skills** (a consuming repo links the ones it vendors in its overlay):

- A **trace-analyzer** skill - the profiler this skill drives to find the hot
  method or source line. The overlay names it and the concrete profiling page.
- A **framework-JIT-optimization** skill, when available - decisions about specialization,
  unrolling, and BCL-delegation on the older Framework JIT that the benchmarks
  here exist to validate.
- A **scratch-buffer-strategy** skill, when available - choosing between zeroed `stackalloc`,
  `[SkipLocalsInit]`, a stack-with-pool-fallback buffer, and an `ArrayPool`
  rental; several benchmarks exist to validate those crossovers.
- A **pre-pr-self-review** skill - which requires a benchmark (or an explicit
  "not measured" note) for any perf claim that drives a Framework-only code
  change.

## The rules that always apply

Five rules cover most measurement work; the sub-pages hold the rest.

1. **Define the operation and validity gate first.** Require nonempty equivalent
   work, populated expected rows, exact operation/phase denominators, and recorded
   identities. See [investigation-workflow.md](investigation-workflow.md).
2. **`-c Release` is mandatory.** Debug runs are not representative.
3. **Make measured work observable.** Return or consume a value derived from the
   work, or validate mutated state outside the timed region. A `void` benchmark is
   not automatically eliminated, but unobserved pure work can be optimized away.
4. **Use `[MemoryDiagnoser]` on BenchmarkDotNet classes** when allocation is in
   scope. Its `Allocated` column is cumulative managed allocation per operation,
   not retained memory.
5. **Run every affected supported TFM.** Pass `-f <tfm>` when the perf project is
   multi-targeted; do not invent a second target for a single-target repository.

For a multi-candidate optimization, **screen before you confirm**: predeclare the
product gate and time/candidate budget, use a narrow short-job benchmark and small
real-scenario pilot, and reject hard-gate failures before broad matrices, retained
runs, or candidate before/after profiling. A lightweight baseline profile may form
the hypothesis; defer candidate attribution until the product pilot passes. The
staged defaults and stop rules are in [investigation-workflow.md](investigation-workflow.md).

```powershell
# One affected TFM; repeat only for additional supported targets the change affects.
dotnet run -c Release -f <tfm> --project <root>.perf -- --filter *MyBenchmark*
```

## Workflow checklist for a new BenchmarkDotNet benchmark

1. Add a `<Name>.cs` file under the perf project with a `public` class in the
   perf namespace. See [authoring.md](authoring.md) for layout, globals, and
   attributes.
2. Decorate the class with `[MemoryDiagnoser]`.
3. Add `[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]` to the reference implementation and
   `[Benchmark]` to each variant.
4. Make the measured work observable through a derived return value, a consumer,
   or post-iteration validation of mutated state.
5. Avoid avoidable helper overhead between the benchmark and system-under-test.
   Resolve overloads with explicit argument types or casts, or split benchmark
   classes; do not rename product APIs merely to obtain a measurement.
6. Build Release: `dotnet build -c Release <root>.perf`.
7. Smoke-test with `--job short --filter *<Name>*` on each supported target
   individually. See [running.md](running.md).
8. Run the full benchmark on every affected supported target (drop `--job short`).
9. Inspect `Allocated` and `Ratio` columns; copy the Markdown report into the PR.
   See [interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md).
10. If one method dominates and you need to know which - or which *line* inside
    it - profile it. See your repo's profiling overlay (the trace-analyzer skill).

When the change is driven by a profile, follow the before/after discipline in
[interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md) (baseline every affected
supported TFM, re-run them, keep full rows, confirm the targeted frame moved).

## Codegen-level optimization rules

For decisions about *how to write* a hot path - whether to specialize a generic
for primitives, choose between scalar/unrolled forms, defer to BCL primitives
like `IndexOf` / `SequenceEqual`, or interpret a Framework-vs-modern divergence -
see the framework-JIT-optimization skill when the consuming repository provides it.
That skill is the right entry point for
"this loop is slow on the older Framework JIT, what should I try?" questions,
while this one is about authoring and running the benchmarks themselves.

To see *why* a result is what it is - the C# lowering, the IL, or the JIT asm
behind a number - see [reading-codegen.md](reading-codegen.md). It covers
sharplab, BenchmarkDotNet's `[DisassemblyDiagnoser]` / `[HardwareCounters]`, the
`DOTNET_JitDisasm*` knobs, and the tiering/PGO traps that bite codegen
inspection.

## Sub-pages

- [interpreting-requests.md](interpreting-requests.md) - turning a user's
  outcome question ("how long?", "how much memory?", "where's the time?", "make
  it faster") into a scenario, a measurement, an answer in their words, and the
  next follow-up to offer. Start here when the request is a question, not a task.
- [authoring.md](authoring.md) - file/class layout, the imported globals, the
  required and optional attributes, and what a benchmark method must do.
- [running.md](running.md) - the `-f <tfm>` requirement, filtering to a class or
  method, the interactive picker, and useful switches.
- [interpreting-results.md](interpreting-results.md) - before/after discipline on supported TFMs and reading the memory columns.
- [investigation-workflow.md](investigation-workflow.md) - staged fail-fast
  screening, fresh-state phase measurement versus profiling, experiment ledgers,
  exact-source oracles, and reconstructable run provenance for multi-step
  investigations.
- [reading-codegen.md](reading-codegen.md) - seeing the C# lowering, IL, and JIT
  asm behind a number: sharplab, `[DisassemblyDiagnoser]`, `[HardwareCounters]`,
  the `DOTNET_JitDisasm*` knobs, and the tiering/PGO inspection traps.

Profiling a benchmark down to the hot method or source line is a repo-specific
page supplied by the overlay (it drives the repo's trace analyzer), not part of
this core.
