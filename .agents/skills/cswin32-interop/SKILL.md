Consult when replacing [DllImport] with source-generated PInvoke.* calls, working with generated Windows.Win32 projections (HANDLE / HMODULE / HRESULT / BOOL and typed enum/constant types), configuring NativeMethods.txt / NativeMethods.json, composing a public PInvoke across foundation/owner/extender packages with extensionReceiver, deciding which support library owns a helper, auditing native allocation and byte/element lengths, selecting compile-time / runtime / analyzer guards for Windows-only code, or choosing between CsWin32 and [LibraryImport]. Not for managed-only changes with no native boundary. Paired with the cswin32-com skill for the struct-based COM layer.

# CsWin32 P/Invoke interop

If `overlay.md` exists beside this file, read it before acting; it contains
repository-specific bindings. This core remains usable without it.

[CsWin32](https://github.com/microsoft/CsWin32) is a source generator that
replaces hand-written `[DllImport]` declarations with generated `PInvoke.*`
calls and strongly-typed projections of Win32 handles, structs, enums, and
constants. You list the API, type, or constant names you need in
`NativeMethods.txt`; the generator emits them and pulls in their dependencies.

This skill is the general P/Invoke layer. The struct-based COM layer builds on
it - see the paired **cswin32-com** skill, whose vtable methods follow the same
[blittable-signatures](blittable-signatures.md) rules.

## Rules

1. **Replace a hand-written `[DllImport]` with `PInvoke.*` when CsWin32 can
  project the API.** After verifying the generated declaration and supporting
  types, delete their hand-written equivalents. Keep a source-generated
  `[LibraryImport]` on .NET 10 and `[DllImport]` on .NET Framework for an
  export absent from the available Win32 metadata. See
  [types-and-constants.md](types-and-constants.md).
2. **Use the generated types directly** (`HANDLE`, `HMODULE`, `HRESULT.S_OK`,
   `FILE_FLAGS_AND_ATTRIBUTES`, ...). Never keep a parallel local copy of a
   Win32 enum or struct CsWin32 already projects.
3. **Call the generated method directly** - no thin wrapper. Within one
   ownership layer, generate once and share internal types with friend
   assemblies. When a downstream package intentionally extends a public owner,
   use the [owner/extender composition](composition.md) model instead.
4. **Prefer CsWin32 for Windows APIs present in its metadata.** Use
  `[LibraryImport]` (or `[DllImport]` on .NET Framework) for private, custom,
  or otherwise unprojectable Windows exports and for non-Windows native calls
  such as `libc`. Keep those signatures blittable under the same rules.
5. **Preserve the original error-handling contract when migrating.** Check the
   old declaration for `PreserveSig` / `SetLastError` / `BOOL` / `HRESULT`
   semantics and reproduce them: `PreserveSig=false` becomes
   `.ThrowOnFailure()`; `SetLastError=true` plus a failed `BOOL` becomes
   `throw new Win32Exception()`. Silently returning where the old code threw is
   a behavior change. The paired cswin32-com skill has the COM-side parity
   table.
6. **Keep signatures blittable.** CsWin32 is configured `allowMarshaling: false`,
   so every `[DllImport]` and every COM vtable method must be blittable. The
   full rule set is in [blittable-signatures.md](blittable-signatures.md).
7. **Audit ownership and size units.** Generated wrappers do not decide which
   allocator frees an output, whether a COM reference remains caller-owned, or
   whether a length is bytes or elements. Record and test those contracts using
   [ownership-and-units.md](ownership-and-units.md).

## Platform and target-framework guards

CsWin32 projects Windows APIs, but compile inclusion, runtime reachability, and
the public platform contract are separate decisions. Generated declarations can
live in a cross-platform assembly; reachable calls still need a recognized
Windows runtime guard or a Windows-only API context. Exclude source at compile
time only when a target intentionally omits that interop surface or one of its
dependencies. In the .NET 10 / .NET Framework target model, use `NET` for the
.NET 10 leg and `NETFRAMEWORK` for the Framework leg. See
[gating.md](gating.md) for the decision table, `CA1416`, and guarded-build
verification. An overlay records the concrete TFMs and any repository-specific
compile symbol or source-item condition.

## Configuration

- **`NativeMethods.txt`** - one API / type / constant name per line; the
  generator projects each and pulls in its dependencies.
- **`NativeMethods.json`** - generator options. `allowMarshaling: false` (raw
  blittable signatures, no marshaller) and `useSafeHandles: false` are the
  interop-friendly defaults these skills assume.
- Run the generator in a single project within an ownership layer and share via
  `InternalsVisibleTo` rather than adding CsWin32 to every implementation
  project. A package that extends another package's public projection is a
  separate layer: configure `className` / `extensionReceiver` as described in
  [composition.md](composition.md).

### Source generator versus build task

The Roslyn source generator is the default. Setting
`CsWin32RunAsBuildTask=true` replaces it with an MSBuild task that writes `.cs`
files under the intermediate output directory and adds them to `Compile`; the
source generator stands down. Treat this as an opt-in for a specific build
ordering, generated-file, or tooling requirement, not as a general upgrade.

Before keeping build-task mode, clean and build all .NET 10 and .NET Framework
TFMs, compare the emitted public API, and measure clean-build time. It can be
materially slower. It also does not make an `allowMarshaling: false` project
more AOT-safe by itself, so do not enable `DisableRuntimeMarshalling` merely
because generation moved to the task.

  shared by `[DllImport]` and COM vtables (`HRESULT`, `T**` vs `out T*`,
  `void*`, `nint`, `PCWSTR` / `PWSTR`, typed enum parameters).

  handle / enum / constant projections, "grep the metadata before redefining",
  type conversions, FILETIME, and native integers.

  shared Win32 support, domain extensions, and applications in a directed
  package stack, with migration and release ordering.

  and deallocators, caller-owned COM references, failure cleanup, and
  byte-versus-element conversions.
- [gating.md](gating.md) - source inclusion, runtime and TFM guards, `CA1416`, a
  stack-first scratch-buffer strategy, and guarded-build verification.
