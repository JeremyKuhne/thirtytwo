description: Guides struct-based COM interop using CsWin32 - AOT-compatible raw pointer calls without [ComImport] or built-in CLR marshalling; managed [ComImport] mirrors are limited to CCW bridges. Consult when working with ComScope, IID.Get, delegate* unmanaged vtables, CoCreateInstance or a class factory, IComIID across .NET 10 and .NET Framework, connection-point Advise/Unadvise ownership, caller-owned CCW references, manually defining COM interfaces absent from Win32 metadata, COM pointer lifetime in fields, cross-assembly CCWs, or mocking struct-based COM in tests. Not for ordinary RCW-based COM consumption with no raw struct pointers or CCW bridge. Paired with the cswin32-interop skill for the general P/Invoke layer and blittable-signature rules.

# CsWin32 struct-based COM interop

If `overlay.md` exists beside this file, read it before acting; it contains
repository-specific bindings. This core remains usable without it.

Struct-based COM interop on top of CsWin32: raw `delegate*` vtable calls and no
built-in CLR marshalling on the native pointer surface, so it is AOT- and
trimming-friendly. A managed `[ComImport]` mirror is allowed only as a narrow
CCW bridge; runtime calls still use the generated struct. This skill covers the
COM-specific layer; the general P/Invoke layer and the blittable-signature rules
that vtable methods also follow live in the paired **cswin32-interop** skill.

## Helper conventions

Examples use `ComScope<T>` for a disposable scope that owns one AddRef'd COM
reference and `IID.Get<T>()` for a support helper that returns a `Guid*` to
`T`'s `IComIID.Guid`. CsWin32 generates `IComIID`, but these two helpers come
from a support library. The overlay names their concrete implementations. If a
repository does not provide them, use an equivalent owned-pointer scope and a
stable IID pointer; keep the same ownership and ABI contracts.

`AcquireOwnedCcwPointer<T>()` in examples is pseudocode for a repository helper
that returns one AddRef'd, caller-owned interface pointer for a managed object.
Its implementation determines compatibility: classic
`Marshal.GetComInterfaceForObject` uses built-in COM interop and is not a
NativeAOT path, while a `ComWrappers` implementation can be AOT-compatible.

## Workflow

1. **In Win32 metadata?** If yes, add the interface name to `NativeMethods.txt`
  and CsWin32 generates it. If not (for example, Setup Configuration or a
  private / third-party interface), define a manual struct in its own file - see
   [manual-structs.md](manual-structs.md).
2. **Lifetime:** `using ComScope<T> scope = new();` for every transient **owned**
   COM reference, and free every owned COM `BSTR` out-param (`SysFreeString` /
   `FreeBSTR`, or a repo-provided scoped `BSTR` wrapper). A correct
   `try` / `finally` also releases on early return, but an owned-pointer scope
   centralizes initialization, release, and ownership transfer. Never release a
   borrowed pointer unless the caller first acquires a reference. See
   [lifetime.md](lifetime.md).
3. **Activate** via a class-factory helper or `CoCreateInstance` with
   the exact interface IID; prefer `IID.Get<T>()` when the support helper is
   available. See [Activation](#activation).
4. **Call** via `scope.Pointer->Method(...)`. Pass `ComScope<T>` directly where
   the API expects `T**` / `void**` when the concrete scope provides those
   conversions.
5. **Match the caller's error contract.** If the top-level consumer treats COM
  failure as a documented "absent" result, helpers may return `default` /
  `false`; otherwise call `.ThrowOnFailure()`. Do not change a shared helper's
  contract merely because one caller catches `COMException`. See the parity
  table in
   [migration-and-testing.md](migration-and-testing.md).
6. **Gate .NET 10-only COM features with `#if NET`.** `ComWrappers`-based CCW
  support is unavailable on .NET Framework. Generated `IComIID` works on both
  supported runtime families with CsWin32 0.3.287 or later; see
  [comiid-and-cls.md](comiid-and-cls.md).
7. **Compose across packages** at the owner boundary. The owner implements
   generated partial hooks and publishes shared COM structs; extenders add
   behavior with extension blocks or uniquely named CCW providers. See
   [ccw-composition.md](ccw-composition.md).

## Activation

```csharp
// Via CoCreateInstance and the repository's IID support helper.
Guid clsid = SomeCoClass.CLSID;
using ComScope<ISomething> instance = new();
PInvoke.CoCreateInstance(
    &clsid, null, CLSCTX.CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, IID.Get<ISomething>(), instance)
    .ThrowOnFailure();
instance.Pointer->DoThing(...);
```

- Prefer `IID.Get<T>()` when available; it returns a `Guid*` to the type's
  `IComIID.Guid` without a per-call copy. Otherwise pass a pointer to a stable
  `Guid` containing the exact IID. A local `Guid` is valid for the duration of
  the native call; the problem is an incorrect or ad hoc IID, not local storage.
- Initialize `ComScope<T>` with `new()`; it implicitly converts to the `T**` /
  `void**` output parameter when the concrete support type supplies those
  conversions.
- A repo may also ship a class-factory helper (activate via `CoGetClassObject`
  then `CreateInstance`), the AOT-friendly path when a CLSID is registered - see
  the overlay.
