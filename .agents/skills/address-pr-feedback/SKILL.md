# Address PR feedback

If `overlay.md` exists beside this file, read it before acting; it contains
repository-specific bindings. This core remains usable without it.

This skill is the post-PR counterpart to the `create-pr` skill. Both share the
**same** publish gate: neither `git commit` nor `git push` runs without an
explicit publishing verb from the user. The difference is what each skill
authorizes you to *edit*:

- `create-pr` authorizes preparing a new PR from in-progress work -
  branching, staging, proposing a commit message. The commit and push
  still wait on approval.
- This skill authorizes editing files in response to review feedback or
  CI failures on an existing PR. Same approval gate before commit/push.

Repository guidance is the source of truth for commit/push approval. Re-read it
at the start of every invocation when present; this skill is a reminder, not a
replacement.

## Recognizing approval

Carefully read the most recent user message and identify whether it
contains an explicit publishing verb before you stage, commit, or push.
Pattern-match the words, do not infer intent.

**Approval** - verbs that authorize publishing the current change:
`commit`, `push`, `update the PR`, `ship it`, `send it`, `yes push`, or
direct synonyms when paired with a publishing intent.

**Not approval** - everything else, including these phrasings that
have repeatedly caused violations:

- "Address the review comments." / "Reply to the comments on the PR." /
  "Fix the comments / fix the CI failure."
- "Look at Copilot's feedback / see what they said."
- "See what you can do about this." / "Try a different approach."
- "Do the next step" / "finish the rollout" / "go ahead to the next
  thing" / a bare "go ahead" attached to a task description.
- A reviewer (human or Copilot) leaving a new comment, or a failing
  check on the PR.

If you are uncertain whether a phrase is approval, **it is not approval**.
Stop and ask one short yes/no question.

## Workflow

1. **Confirm the PR is open, then fetch feedback.** If it was merged, stop and
    propose a user-approved follow-up such as a revert or new PR. If it was closed
    without merging, stop and propose reopening it or creating a new PR. Do not
    mutate the old branch in either case. Read every unresolved review thread
    across all review passes, including replies, plus the PR conversation and
    compact check statuses. Fetch logs only for failed checks being investigated.
    Do not filter by newest review id - older unresolved threads remain
    actionable. Prefer a PR tool; use
    [thread-workflow.md](thread-workflow.md) for the `gh` fallback.

   Automated reviewers (e.g. Copilot) post asynchronously - on open, on push, or
   when requested - a minute or two after the trigger. If one was requested but
   hasn't posted, say so and act when the user reports comments (or check once);
   don't poll. Verify their comments per step 2 - they produce confident false
   positives.
2. **Plan, and verify each comment.** Don't fix something just because a reviewer
   (especially a bot) flagged it: confirm the claim against the code, and prove
   it when checkable (a REPL check, a build, a test) - a fix to a false positive
   can introduce the bug the reviewer imagined. Classify each:
   - **Valid** - real issue; fix it.
   - **Nit** - minor; fix if cheap, else note it.
   - **Out of scope** - plan a written reply.
   - **False positive / disagree** - plan a written explanation, not a change.
3. **Edit files.** Make the code changes. Run the build and any relevant
   tests. The applicable validation rules are still the `pre-pr-self-review`
   checklist - a follow-up round needs the same checks as the initial PR.
4. **Stop. Describe.** Summarize what you changed, why, and what (if
   anything) you chose not to act on. Do **not** run `git add`, `git
   commit`, or `git push`.
5. **Wait** for an explicit publishing verb (see "Recognizing approval"
   above).
6. **Only then** recheck that the PR is open before staging or committing. Commit
    the round, then confirm the PR is still open immediately before each remote
    write in steps 6-8; abort and report if it is not. Push using the mechanics in
    the `create-pr` skill.
7. **Reply in-thread, then resolve.** These are PR write actions. Follow repository
    guidance; when it does not bundle them with push/update approval, get explicit
    approval. Refresh each targeted thread before writing: skip one already
    resolved, and reclassify one with new replies. Write one scoped reply per
    thread: state what changed for a fix, or give the evidence for a false positive
    or won't-fix. Do not combine answers across threads or post the review summary
    to the PR conversation. Leave a thread open only to invite a human onto a
    contested point, and say so.
    Verify both operations; a reply does not resolve a thread. Report what you did.
8. **Get the next review when non-trivial.** If the repository automatically
    reviews pushes, never request or re-request review; let the automatic pass run
    without polling. Otherwise, after real code changes, request a fresh pass from
    the same reviewer using the repository's PR-write approval policy. Skip a
    manual request for trivial rounds (typo, reword, one-line nit), and say which
    path applies.

**When to stop.** Later auto-review passes drift toward nits and false positives.
Before calling the PR ready, confirm it is open, non-draft, mergeable, required
checks and reviews are satisfied, no review threads remain unresolved, and the
latest requested or automatic review has completed. Account for every actionable
PR-conversation comment with a response or recorded disposition as well.
Otherwise report what is pending. Once comments stop being substantive, stop
requesting additional manual reviews and let the user merge.

## When you've already violated the rule

Acknowledge the violation directly without minimizing. Do **not** push a
follow-up commit to "fix" the situation without explicit approval -
that compounds the failure. The user decides whether to revert,
force-push, or leave the commit in place.
