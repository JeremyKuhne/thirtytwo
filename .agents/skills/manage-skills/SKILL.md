description: Find, build, review, update, retire, and share agent skills in this repo. Use when asked to find a skill, build/create one (find runs first), review its trigger routing or workflow effectiveness, update/sync it, retire/remove it, or reconcile a local change against the commons vs an overlay. Covers tiered search, find-first building, semantic invocation/workflow review, pull/push updates, and safe retirement. For frontmatter/schema/link diagnostics, use `agent-files-review`.

# Manage skills

If `overlay.md` exists beside this file, read it before acting; it contains
repository-specific bindings. This core remains usable without it.

The lifecycle skill for the skills under a repo's `.agents/skills/`: discover one,
add one, review whether it guides agents effectively, update or retire it, and keep
local changes in sync with the shared set. It turns "find a skill", "build a skill",
"is this skill effective", "update the skill", and "remove this skill" into actions
aligned with the sharing model instead of ad-hoc edits.

The model in one paragraph: skills are authored once as a portable **core** and
shared through a common skills repo (the **commons**); each consuming repo holds a
pinned, provenance-stamped **copy** plus a thin repo-specific **overlay**. The
commons is bidirectional - a generic improvement made in any repo flows back
upstream, while a repo-specific tweak lives only in that repo's overlay.

## The five verbs

| Ask | Do | Detail |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that does X" | Tiered search (local -> commons -> public), with an applicability check for this repo. | [find.md](find.md) |
| "build a skill for X", "create a skill" | **Run find first.** Only author new if it exists nowhere; otherwise vendor or tweak the existing one. | [build.md](build.md) |
| "review this skill", "is this skill effective" | Review invocation, workflow closure, progressive disclosure, portability, and lifecycle placement; then hand file validation to `agent-files-review`. | [review.md](review.md) |
| "update the skill", "sync my change", "pull skill updates" | Pull upstream drift; or push a local improvement, classified common (ask before upstreaming) vs deviation (overlay). | [update.md](update.md) |
| "retire this skill", "remove this skill" | Find dependents and replacements first, then deprecate or remove without leaving stale routing, catalog, packaging, or validation state. | [retire.md](retire.md) |

These chain: `build` always begins with `find`; `build` and `update` finish with
`review`; and `review` finishes with `agent-files-review` for file-level validation.
A local skill that needs a tweak follows `update` so core/overlay ownership stays
explicit. `retire` begins with a dependency/routing inventory and finishes with a
review of the replacement path plus `agent-files-review`.

## The golden rule

When you change a skill that was vendored from the commons: **never let a vendored
core diverge silently.** A vendored core is a mirror of upstream. Classify the
edit, then place it - and **nothing about upstreaming is automatic**:

- **Local deviation** (the change is specific to this repo) -> move it into the
  repo's **overlay**, and restore the vendored core to match upstream.
- **Common** (the change helps every consumer) -> it *should* go upstream, but
  upstreaming is not always plausible. **Ask** before attempting it; never open a
  commons PR unprompted. If upstreamed, re-pin to the new version; if not yet,
  keep it as a recorded *pending-upstream divergence* so it is intentional, not
  silent.

So a vendored-core edit ends in one of three **recorded** states - upstreamed,
moved to the overlay, or a tracked pending-upstream divergence - never an
unexplained one. The provenance frontmatter (source repo, ref, and tree SHA) plus
the `update` drift check is what enforces this: unexplained drift is the signal
that an improvement was written into the wrong layer. See [update.md](update.md).

## Conventions every skill follows

Whatever the verb, the result must satisfy the repo's authoring rules
(`FORMAT.md`) and then pass `agent-files-review`, which owns the file-level
checks - frontmatter, mirror sync, whitespace, and the validator and link
checker. Don't restate those rules here.

For the `SKILL.md` frontmatter check specifically, this skill bundles
[scripts/Validate-Skills.ps1](scripts/Validate-Skills.ps1) - a dependency-free
PowerShell port of the Agent Skills spec validator - so the check runs anywhere
the skill is vendored, without the upstream tool. Run it on the skill directory:
`pwsh scripts/Validate-Skills.ps1 <skill-dir>`. A commons portfolio uses
`-RequirePortfolioMetadata` to enforce its metadata and overlay contract.

For a new downstream binding, start from
`assets/overlay.md.tmpl`, replace its skill and pin tokens, and keep every local
path and concrete cross-reference in that overlay.

## Sub-pages

- [find.md](find.md) - the tiered search, the applicability check, and the
  recommendation report.
- [build.md](build.md) - the find-first decision tree, the security gate for
  public sources, and authoring a new skill (born-local vs born-shared).
- [review.md](review.md) - semantic and lifecycle review: invocation, agent
  execution, progressive disclosure, portability, overlap, and maintenance.
- [update.md](update.md) - the pull (drift) and push (common vs deviation)
  flows and the provenance mechanics behind the golden rule.
- [retire.md](retire.md) - dependency-first deprecation or removal without stale
  routing, catalog, packaging, or validation state.

## Disambiguation

`manage-skills` operates on **skill lifecycle and effectiveness**: discover, add,
review semantic workflow quality, vendor, and sync. It is not
`agent-files-review`, which validates **agent-file correctness**: frontmatter,
schema/conventions, mirror sync, whitespace, links, and diagnostics. A complete
skill review uses both in that order; neither substitutes for the other. For an
overlay, `manage-skills` decides what belongs there, while `agent-files-review`
validates the resulting overlay file.
